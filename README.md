# tf2logs_playerstats
cli tool to compile stats of individual players by class from any collection of logs

**WIP**

this tool allows a user to input any selection of log links (logs.tf/xxxxxxx) and a class, and the tool will return a set of players' compiled stats based on the class that the user inputs.

example input/output can be found [here](https://pastebin.com/dAh1vqkH)

tool can currently only be used by running it in console (node index.js), a more user-friendly release method will be available soonTM
